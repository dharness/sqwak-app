Sqwak lets you create an audio classifier without writing any code!
To train your classifier, create some bins (such as 'clanking' 'quacking' and 'rock music') and upload your music into the appropriate bin.
After that, click the train button and voila, your classifier is now available at an api endpoint like sqwak.kingofthestack.com/user/234fh3jd3j4/app/fkf93m39f3mf/classify
You can now POST to that endpoint with completely new sounds your classifier has never seen before, and it'll attempt to label it.
